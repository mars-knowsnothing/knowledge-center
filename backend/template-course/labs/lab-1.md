# Lab 1: Getting Started - Basic Implementation

## Lab Objectives
By completing this lab, you will:
- Set up your development environment
- Create your first basic implementation
- Understand the fundamental workflow
- Practice essential commands and operations

## Prerequisites
- Completed reading: Module 1 slides
- Basic understanding of the concepts
- Required tools installed (see setup guide)

## Lab Environment
- **Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes
- **Difficulty Level**: Beginner
- **Tools Required**: 
  - Code editor (VS Code recommended)
  - Terminal/Command line
  - Web browser for testing

## Instructions

### Step 1: Environment Setup (10 minutes)
1. Create a new project directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-first-project
   cd my-first-project
   ```

2. Initialize your project:
   ```bash
   # Replace with appropriate initialization command
   init --template basic
   ```

3. Verify the setup:
   ```bash
   # Check that everything is working
   status --check
   ```

### Step 2: Basic Implementation (20 minutes)
1. Create the main file:
   ```javascript
   // main.js - Replace with your language/framework
   function hello() {
     console.log("Hello from Lab 1!");
     return "Success!";
   }
   
   // Call the function
   hello();
   ```

2. Add configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "lab-1-project",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "My first lab exercise"
   }
   ```

3. Test your implementation:
   ```bash
   # Run your code
   run main.js
   ```

### Step 3: Exploration and Experimentation (10 minutes)
1. Try modifying the code:
   - Change the message text
   - Add a new function
   - Test different parameters

2. Experiment with options:
   - Try different configuration settings
   - Explore available commands
   - Check help documentation

## Expected Outputs
When completed successfully, you should see:
- ✅ Project directory created
- ✅ Files properly structured
- ✅ Code runs without errors
- ✅ Expected output displayed

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Environment is set up correctly
- [ ] Basic implementation works
- [ ] Code produces expected output
- [ ] You understand the basic workflow
- [ ] Project files are properly organized

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Setup Problems
**Symptom**: Installation or initialization fails
**Solution**: 
1. Check system requirements
2. Verify permissions
3. Review installation guide
4. Check for conflicting software

### Issue 2: Code Doesn't Run
**Symptom**: Errors when executing code
**Solution**:
1. Check syntax carefully
2. Verify file names and paths
3. Ensure proper file encoding
4. Review error messages for clues

### Issue 3: Unexpected Output
**Symptom**: Code runs but output is wrong
**Solution**:
1. Compare with provided examples
2. Check variable names and values
3. Verify function calls
4. Debug step by step

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)
If you finish early, try these additional exercises:

### Challenge A: Customization
- Modify the code to accept user input
- Add error handling
- Create multiple functions

### Challenge B: Extension
