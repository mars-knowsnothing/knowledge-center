## Technical Considerations

### Markdown Syntax
This system supports:
- Headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Lists and tables
- Links and images
- HTML when needed

### File References
Reference assets using relative paths:
```markdown
![Diagram](assets/images/my-diagram.png)
[Download Template](assets/documents/template.pdf)
```

### Code Examples
Use fenced code blocks with language specification:
```javascript
function example() {
  console.log("This will be syntax highlighted");
}
```
